[Structurizr](https://structurizr.com) provides a tool to document the architecture of your software in a document as
code.  The software allows you to create multiple diagrams from a single model of your application.  Structurizr
supports the [C4 model for visualizing software architecture](https://c4model.com/).  Structurizr makes diagrams
interactive, animatable, and embeddable.

To get going with Structurizr following the installation instructions at the [Structurizr Lite](https://structurizr.com/help/lite)
installation page to set up Structurizr on your own machine.  The workspace.dsl file in the doc/structurizr directory
contains the current model and view definitions used to generate the graphics for the [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md)
documentation page.
